# SNIM: Stochastic Network Interaction model 

This is a C++11 implementation of a stochastic multispecies model. The model has multiple applications to investigate the relationship between ecological interactions (competition, predation) and diversity. It involves a discrete definition
of individuals belonging to a given set of species. The dynamics is essentially probabilistic at the microscopic
scale, but it leads to recognizable macroscopic patterns both in space and time. The model in is actual version is spatially implicit but a spatially explicit version is planned. A more complete definition of the model can be found in:

## Building	 using cmake

To build using cmake you should create a folder bin and run

```
   cmake .. -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
   make
```

It could be usefull in windows systems to compile with static libraries and MinGW compiler
   
```
   cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles" -DLINK_STATIC_LIBS=ON 
   mingw32-make
```
